# Development-Of-Lidar-Sensor-And-Mapping-Environment
This LiDAR system uses the VL53L0X sensor, MPU6050, a servo motor, and Arduino Uno to capture spatial data and orientation. It measures laser pulse reflections for distance mapping. Programmed via Arduino IDE and analyzed in VS Code, it's ideal for robotics, obstacle detection, and environmental mapping.
